To use authentication from external source, follow the instructions given below:

1.  In settings.py, 
    Uncomment AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ('myauthentication.backend.MyBackend',)
    Uncomment AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ('myauthentication.backend.MyBackend',)
    Enter database name, username and password for the spoken tutorial database.

2. From login.html template comment 'New User? Sign-Up' link.
   This is to be done so that user will register only from external
   application and their details will be stored in the external database.

3. In urls.py comment 'register' url pattern.
